# graph-vs-relational-traversal

At what traversal depth, and at what data volume, does a property graph model outperform an equivalent normalized relational model for the same query?

## Dataset

Data source: [GH Archive](https://www.gharchive.org/), which publishes hourly
dumps of every public GitHub event. See
[docs_english/gh-archive-guide.md](docs_english/gh-archive-guide.md) for a full explanation of
what GH Archive is and how it works.

This project uses a single, fixed hour for reproducibility:

- **Date/hour:** 2026-08-27, 15:00 UTC
- **URL:** https://data.gharchive.org/2026-08-27-15.json.gz
- **Why this hour:** a weekday (Thursday), within the ~13:00-19:00 UTC window
  where US and European activity overlap, giving high event volume for
  building a meaningfully connected graph. It is also comfortably in the past,
  so the file is guaranteed to be published and available.

Download it with:

```bash
