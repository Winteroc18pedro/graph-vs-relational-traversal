# Understanding GH Archive

This guide builds up from first principles: what GitHub events are, what GH
Archive does with them, what the files actually contain, and how to turn that
into usable data for this project.

> The specific date/hour this project actually uses as its dataset is recorded

> project.

## 1. What is a "GitHub event"?

Every time something happens on a *public* GitHub repository — someone pushes
commits, opens an issue, opens a pull request, comments, forks a repo, stars a
repo, creates a branch, and so on — GitHub records that as a discrete **event**.
Conceptually, this is just a log entry: "at this timestamp, this user did this
action to this repository."

GitHub exposes a live feed of these as its public Events API. But a live feed
is not useful for research — you can't go back in time and ask "what happened
last Tuesday." You need something that has been recording continuously and
lets you fetch a specific slice of the past.

## 2. What GH Archive is

GH Archive is a long-running project (started in 2011, still running) that sits
on top of GitHub's public event feed and does one job: continuously record
every public event, bundle them up **by hour**, and publish each hour as a
downloadable file, permanently, at a predictable URL. It is not affiliated with
GitHub itself — it's an independent archival project — but it uses GitHub's own
public data, so it is a faithful historical record of public GitHub activity.

The practical result: for *any* hour since 2011, you can fetch a file
containing every public event that happened on GitHub during that hour,
worldwide.

## 3. Why this matters for your project

Your research question is about when a graph model outperforms a relational
model for multi-hop queries. To test that, you need a real dataset with
genuine relationships in it — not synthetic data you invented, which risks
having an artificial shape that flatters one model or the other.

GH Archive events naturally encode a graph:

```
User --[pushed to]--> Repository
User --[starred]-----> Repository
User --[forked]-------> Repository
User --[opened PR on]-> Repository
```

A "repo" can also connect back out to other users (e.g. everyone who starred
it), so following chains of these relationships — "users who starred repos
that were forked by users who also pushed to..." — is precisely the kind of
multi-hop traversal your research question is about. The same event records
can be flattened into relational tables (a `users` table, a `repos` table, an
`events` table with foreign keys) or loaded as nodes and edges in a graph
database, giving you a like-for-like comparison on real-world data.

## 4. The URL structure

Every hourly file lives at:

```
https://data.gharchive.org/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{H}.json.gz
```

- `{YYYY-MM-DD}` — the date, e.g. `2026-08-27`.
- `{H}` — the hour **in UTC**, from `0` to `23`, written **without** a leading
  zero (`5`, not `05`; `15` stays `15`).

So `https://data.gharchive.org/2026-08-27-15.json.gz` would be every public
GitHub event that occurred between 15:00:00 and 15:59:59 UTC on August 27,
2026 — used here purely as an example of the URL shape.

There is no API key, authentication, or rate limit for downloading these files
— they are static files on a server, fetched like any other download.

## 5. Recency and availability — why you can't use "right now"

GH Archive can only publish a file for an hour that has **fully finished**,
because it needs every event from `:00` to `:59` of that hour before it can
bundle and publish it. Two practical consequences:

- **You can't pick the current, still-in-progress hour** — it doesn't exist as
  a file yet, because it hasn't finished happening.
- **There's a short publishing lag after an hour ends.** GH Archive needs a
  little time to collect and package the just-finished hour, so even the most
  recently completed hour may not be available for download immediately. In
  practice this delay is generally short (well under an hour), but there's no
  hard guarantee on exactly when a given hour's file will appear.

For research purposes there's a second, more important reason to avoid "the
present moment" regardless of publishing lag: **reproducibility**. Your
project's whole point is a measurable, comparable result — if the dataset were
defined as "whatever hour it is when you run this," the input would be
different every time the pipeline runs, and nobody (including future you)
could reproduce your results. The fix is simple: pick one specific, fixed
date and hour, safely in the past (a few hours old is already more than
enough margin), and record that exact value once — that becomes a constant
input, not something computed at run time.

## 6. What's inside the file

The filename ends in `.json.gz`. That name tells you two things are stacked:

1. **`.gz`** — the outer layer is gzip compression, the same compression used
   by `.zip`-adjacent tools. You must decompress this before you can read
   anything.
2. **`.json`** — after decompressing, you get text. But despite the `.json`
   extension, it is **not one big JSON document**. It's in a format called
   **JSON Lines** (sometimes `.jsonl`): every line of the file is a complete,
   independent JSON object, and there are no commas or brackets joining lines
   together. A file with 60,000 events is a text file with 60,000 lines, each
   one independently parseable.

This matters practically: you cannot do `json.load()` (parse-the-whole-file)
on it in most languages — you read it line by line and call the JSON parser on
each line individually.

### Anatomy of one event

A single line, once parsed, looks approximately like this (fields trimmed for
clarity):

```json
{
  "id": "40123456789",
  "type": "PushEvent",
  "actor": {
    "id": 987654,
    "login": "some-user"
  },
  "repo": {
    "id": 111222,
    "name": "someorg/somerepo"
  },
  "payload": {
    "commits": [ { "sha": "...", "message": "..." } ]
  },
  "created_at": "2026-08-27T15:03:11Z"
}
```

Key fields:

- **`type`** — the kind of event. Common ones: `PushEvent` (code pushed),
  `WatchEvent` (this is GitHub's internal name for **starring** a repo, not
  literally "watching"), `ForkEvent`, `PullRequestEvent`, `IssuesEvent`,
  `IssueCommentEvent`, `CreateEvent` (new branch/tag/repo), `DeleteEvent`.
- **`actor`** — the GitHub user who performed the action.
- **`repo`** — the repository the action happened on.
- **`payload`** — extra detail specific to the event type (e.g. for a
  `PushEvent`, the actual commits; for a `PullRequestEvent`, PR details).
- **`created_at`** — timestamp of the event.

For building a graph, the fields you almost always care about are `type`,
`actor.login`, `repo.name`, and `created_at` — that's enough to construct
`(user)-[ACTION]->(repo)` edges. The `payload` is usually only needed if your
analysis cares about the content of the action, not just that it happened.

## 7. Getting the data onto your machine

Since it's a plain HTTPS file, any of these work (substitute the actual
date/hour this project uses, as recorded in the README):

```bash
# curl
curl -O https://data.gharchive.org/YYYY-MM-DD-H.json.gz

# wget
wget https://data.gharchive.org/YYYY-MM-DD-H.json.gz
```

Or simply paste the URL into a browser — it downloads like any file.

Then decompress it:

```bash
gunzip YYYY-MM-DD-H.json.gz
# produces: YYYY-MM-DD-H.json
```

(Many programming languages can also read `.gz` files directly, streaming the
decompression, without a separate manual unzip step — e.g. Python's `gzip`
module.)

## 8. Reading it into code

A minimal Python example, reading line by line so the whole file never has to
sit in memory at once:

```python
import gzip
import json

with gzip.open("YYYY-MM-DD-H.json.gz", "rt", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    for line in f:
        event = json.loads(line)
        if event["type"] in ("PushEvent", "ForkEvent", "WatchEvent"):
            actor = event["actor"]["login"]
            repo = event["repo"]["name"]
            # record (actor, event["type"], repo, event["created_at"])
```

From there, the same extracted `(actor, type, repo, timestamp)` records can be:

- Inserted into relational tables (`users`, `repos`, `events` with foreign
  keys to both), or
- Inserted as nodes (`User`, `Repo`) and edges (`PUSHED`, `STARRED`, `FORKED`)
  in a graph database.

Because both models are built from the *identical* extracted records, any
performance difference you measure between them is attributable to the
storage/query model — not to differences in the underlying data.

## 9. Scaling up later

A single hour typically contains tens of thousands of events — enough to
build a real graph with meaningful multi-hop structure. If later experiments
need more volume (e.g. to push traversal depth further before hitting
diminishing returns), you can repeat the same download-and-parse process for
additional hours or days — GH Archive files are addressed individually, so
scaling up just means fetching more of them and merging the extracted
records, no format changes needed.

## 10. Alternative: querying without downloading files

GH Archive's data is also mirrored into Google BigQuery as public tables
(`githubarchive.hour.YYYYMMDD_HH`, and daily/yearly rollups). If you have (or
set up) Google Cloud access, you can run SQL directly against these tables in
a browser — useful for quick exploratory questions ("how many `ForkEvent`s
happened in this hour?") without writing any download/parsing code. This is
entirely optional for this project; downloading and parsing a single hourly
file directly, as described above, is sufficient and keeps the dependency list
smaller.
