# This is a line-by-line explained duplicate of scripts/peek_data.py.
# It is NOT meant to be run as part of the project pipeline — it lives in
# docs_english/ because its purpose is to teach, not to execute. The real, "clean"
# script (with none of this commentary) is scripts/peek_data.py.
#
# This file assumes you've already read docs_english/download_gharchive.py — the
# fundamentals explained there (docstrings, imports, Path, type hints,
# f-strings, argparse, main(), the __name__ guard) are NOT re-explained
# from scratch here. This file focuses on what's NEW in peek_data.py.

# json: the standard library module for converting between JSON text and
# Python objects. `json.loads(text)` ("load string") parses a JSON-formatted
# string into Python values — a JSON object like {"a": 1} becomes a Python
# dict, a JSON array becomes a Python list, and so on. This is exactly what
# we need here: each line of the data file is one JSON object as text, and
# we want it as a Python dict we can pull fields out of.
#
# (Compare `json.loads` with `json.load` — no "s" — which reads directly
# from an already-open file instead of from a string. We use `loads` here
# because we're handling one already-read line of text at a time, not an
# entire file object.)

# DEFAULT_FILE: same Path-building technique as DATA_DIR in
# download_gharchive.py — computed from this script's own location
# (__file__), walking up to the project root (.parent.parent), then down
# into data/2026-08-27-15.json. This hardcodes the specific dataset file
# this project uses as the default target to peek at, while still letting
# --file override it for a different downloaded hour.

    #                      "rb"/"wb" (binary modes) — plain "r" here means
    #                      TEXT mode: Python automatically decodes the raw
    #                      bytes on disk into a Python str as you read,
    #                      using the given encoding. Binary mode was right
    #                      for download_gharchive.py because we were just
    #                      relaying bytes through unchanged; here we
    #                      actually want to interpret the content as text
    #                      (specifically, as JSON), so text mode is correct.
    #   encoding="utf-8"    JSON Lines files (and JSON in general) are
    #                      near-universally UTF-8 encoded. Being explicit

    #                      whatever the operating system's default happens
    #                      to be, avoids subtle bugs where the same file
    #                      might be read differently on different machines
    #                      (e.g. Windows sometimes defaults to a different
    #                      encoding than macOS/Linux).

    # file is automatically and reliably closed once we're done with it.

        # f.readline() in a loop). But we also want to know WHICH line

        # and to know when to stop.

        # (index, line) — starting the index at 0 by default. Writing
        # `for i, line in enumerate(f):` unpacks that pair directly into

            #                            object), and 'login' is a key
            #                            inside THAT nested dict — this

            #                            shown in gh-archive-guide.md
            #                            (the "actor": {"login": ...} shape).
            # event['repo']['name']       same nested-lookup idea, reaching
            #                            into the 'repo' sub-object.
            # event['created_at']         a plain top-level lookup again.

            # The `!r` inside each f-string placeholder (e.g. {event['type']!r})
            # requests the "repr" (representation) of the value instead of
            # its plain string form. For strings, this wraps the value in
            # quotes in the output (e.g. 'PushEvent' instead of PushEvent),
            # which makes it visually unambiguous where one field's value
            # ends and the next field's label begins when scanning the
            # printed output.
            #
            # This one print() call is split across four lines in the
            # source code using implicit string concatenation — Python
            # automatically joins adjacent string literals that appear
            # next to each other with nothing but whitespace/newlines
            # between them, so this is really just one long f-string
            # written across multiple lines for readability.

# parse_args(): same overall pattern as download_gharchive.py's version,
# with two differences worth calling out:
#
#   type=Path (for --file)
#     Whereas download_gharchive.py's --date argument stayed a plain
#     string, here we tell argparse to convert the --file value straight
#     into a Path object (argparse will call Path("whatever the user
#     typed") for us). That means args.file is already a proper Path
#     by the time peek() receives it, instead of a raw string we'd have
#     to convert ourselves.
#
#   No `choices=` restriction on --lines
#     download_gharchive.py restricted --hour to range(0, 24) because
#     only 24 values are ever valid. Here, --lines is just "however many
#     you want to see" — any positive integer is reasonable, so there's
#     no fixed set of valid choices to restrict it to.
